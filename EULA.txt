Information solely in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and (b)

not to disclose, or permit to be disclosed, either directly or indirectly, 

Confidential Information to any third party.  Further and without limiting the 

generality of the foregoing, Licensee agrees that neither it, nor any of its 

employees, will use for their own account or for the account of any third party 

any Confidential Information, and that Licensee shall be fully responsible for 

the conduct of its employees for any breach of this Agreement. Licensee shall

order with respect thereto.



6.3    Remedy.  If Licensee breaches, or threatens to breach, the provisions of 

this Section 6 ("Confidential Information"), Licensee agrees that Falcon would

either party, and shall not be deemed to affect this Agreement.



7.2     Payment Terms.  Licensee shall pay all Fees invoiced by Falcon within 

thirty (30) days of the invoice date.  For any amounts not paid within thirty 

(30) days of invoice date, Licensee shall pay Falcon one and one half percent 

(1.5%) interest per month on the unpaid balance, or the maximum amount permitted

by law, whichever is less, until all past due amounts are satisfied. Licensee 

shall further be responsible for all costs incurred by Falcon in connection with 

any claim made by Falcon in order to recover payment of overdue fees, including 

without limitation, all professional fees and legal costs.  For any late payment 

of Fees, Falcon may also treat such late payment as a material breach of this 

Agreement, may therefore suspend its own performance, and may exercise such 

other rights as Falcon may have under law.



7.3    Taxes.  Fees specified hereunder do not include and are net of any 

foreign or domestic governmental taxes or charges of any kind that may be 

applicable to the Software, including without limitation excise, sales, use, 

property, license, value-added taxes, franchise, income, withholding or similar

9.1    By Falcon.  Falcon warrants to Licensee that for a period of ninety (90) 

days after installation, the media on which the Software is delivered shall be free

such warranty, Falcon will repair or replace any defective media called to 

Falcon's attention during such warranty period.  The foregoing warranty will not 

apply to Licensee’s unauthorized use of the Software.



9.2    Disclaimer.  Except for the limited warranty set forth above, THE 

SOFTWARE (INCLUDING DOCUMENTATION) AND ALL DELIVERABLE ITEMS PROVIDED HEREUNDER 

BY FALCON ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. FALCON MAKES NO 

PROMISES, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, 

OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING ITEMS, INCLUDING AS TO THEIR 

CONDITION, THEIR CONFORMITY TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR DESCRIPTION, OR THE 

EXISTENCE OF ANY LATENT OR PATENT DEFECTS, AND FALCON SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL 

OTHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF

WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL WORK 

WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS.



10.    Indemnity.

10.1    By Falcon.  Falcon shall defend and/or settle all third party claims 

alleging direct infringement by the Software of any third party copyright, 

trademark or trade secret arising out of or related to Licensee’s authorized 

use of the Software, and Falcon shall pay all damages finally awarded; provided 

that Licensee:  (a) promptly notifies Falcon in writing of any claim, action, 

suit, or other proceeding brought by third parties for which it is seeking 

indemnification; (b) provides Falcon with sole control of the defense and/or 

settlement thereof; and (c) provides Falcon, at Falcon’s request and expense, 

with reasonable assistance and full information with respect thereto.  Licensee

shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, with counsel of its own

choosing in the defense and/or settlement of such claim, suit or proceeding. If

the Software becomes, or in Falcon's opinion is likely to become, the subject of 

a claim of infringement, Falcon may, in its sole discretion: (x) procure for 

Licensee the right to continue using the Software; (y) replace or modify the 

Software so that it becomes non-infringing; or (z) terminate the license for 

such Software, and grant Licensee credit for the associated License Fees based 

on a five (5) year straight-line depreciation, and accept its return.

("Indemnity") shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, suit 

or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of Falcon.  

The failure to deliver written notice to Falcon within a reasonable time after 

the commencement of any such claim, suit or proceeding, if prejudicial to its 

ability to defend such action, shall relieve Falcon of any liability hereunder.



10.3    Sole Remedy. THE FOREGOING STATES THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY OF 

FALCON AND LICENSEE’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OF 

ANY THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF LICENSE FEES ACTUALLY 

PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE.  EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 2 

("LICENSE"), SECTION 3 ("LICENSE LIMITATIONS"), OR SECTION 6 ("CONFIDENTIAL 

INFORMATION"), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY 

INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON 

ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING 

NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING

BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF USE OF

ANY FILES, DATA OR EQUIPMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 

DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL
